### As Child

**_asChild_** attribute allows to copy Button props to the first and only child. This allows to simplify styling of other triggers, links, etc.

For example, we want to have a "Button-Link",
that is going to look like link, but have a behaviour of Link component from 'react-router-dom'. We can easily achieve such a result by using **_'asChild'_** props:

```
<Button variant="outlined" color="danger" asChild>
    <Link to="/test" />
</Button>
```

**_Note: Most of the Triggers also have 'asChild' prop. For example, PopoverTrigger, DropdownTrigger, DialogTrigger._**

### Styling Warning

Because of some global styling in the WebApp, styling absolutely any button with Tailwind CSS has problem regarding text size/weight.
Tailwind CSS properties `text-sm text-lg ...` and `font-normal font-medium font-bold` are overwritten by global styling with `!important`

To bypass this problem, simply add `!` before Tailwind CSS class, ex: `className="bg-primary !text-sm !font-normal text-white"`

### Props

**_Button_** accept all default **_HTML Button Element_** props as well as 2 additional attributes: **_'variant'_** and **_'asChild'_**

**_'variant'_** attribute is responsible for appearance of the Button

**_'asChild'_** attribute allows to render Button as part of the child component passed into Button.
